    Building innovative solutions for you and your community
</p>
<hr> 
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hi! 
We are a small software developer team from Munich in Germany. We love creating new, innovative and user-focused software solutions. We focus on our customers instead of maximizing profit and love our community. </p>
<h3>Some projects</h3>
Feel free to check out our <a href="https://scootkit.net">website</a> to learn about our current main projects, but here are some that could be interesting for you:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://scnx.xyz">SCNX</a>: Create your very own Discord-Bot and more for your community (only german currently)</li>
    <ul><li>The code of the CustomBot (the bot you can configure and host for free) can be found here on <a href="https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot">GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Currently we are not able to publish more of our projects - but we'd love to - as we can't finance the infrastructural costs of our services right now.</li>
</ul>

Currently, our official Dev-Team only consists of me, <a href="https://github.com/scderox">@SCDerox</a>, hii  ðŸ‘‹\
Just some short words about me: I am a student from germany who runs this company as a side business and loses money on it, but I really enjoy doing stuff like this and working on new things ^^

<h3>Support us</h3>
As mentioned above I actively lose money on projects like this, so feel free to contribute by buying <a href="https://scnx.xyz/plans#credits">Credits</a> (currency to upgrade your plan in <a href="https://scxn.xyz">SCNX</a>) or support us more directly on <a href="https://patreon.com/scnetwork">Patreon</a>.

<h3>Our Tech-Stacks</h3>
We have published most of our Tech-Stacks on <a href="https://stackshare.io/companies/scootkit#tech-stacks">stackshare</a> - feel free to check them out!


<h3>Questions?</h3>
Feel free to join our <a href="https://sc-net.work/dc">Discord-Server</a> and ask, we are happy to answer any questions you might have.\
ðŸ’¡ Important: If you have any questions with any of our open-source-repositorys, please create an issue in it or use discussions as we can't provide support for them on our Discord.

Thanks and have a nice day ðŸ’•
